# Notch-Apple-Recipe-Datapack
This datapack brings back the removed crafting recipe for the Enchanted Golden Apple in Minecraft version 1.9. Additionally, to balance gameplay, Notch Apples found in structures are slightly buffed.

1. Minecraft compatible version = +1.21.X (datapack tested and developed on Minecraft 1.21.5)
2. Contains a Resourcepack (optional).

If you find a bug, report it on the [DATAPACK WEBPAGE](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/notch-apple-recipe/).

# IMPORTANT! #
1. The Enchanted Golden Apples found in structures only give the buff if the loot was not generated beforehand (only new generated). If you already have this type of       apple, execute the following command to update it while selecting the item: 

    `/function creeperx365:notch_apple/change_apple`

2. In case you want to uninstall the datapack execute the following command:

    `/function creeperx365:notch_apple/uninstall/uninstall`
